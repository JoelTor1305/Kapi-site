### 1. Title and Description

This book is a handbook for life in a world full of temptations - from dopamine and social media to deep work, optimism, and the art of building goals. You will discover how to regain focus, find real joy, and turn dreams into a plan. This is not theory - it is practical tools to help you take control of yourself and start creating the future you truly want.

### 2. Weaknesses

Everyone knows that moment when the day passes, and you are left with a strange feeling inside that "I could have done more." It is not because you are lazy. It is because your brain is working in a mode that takes away your focus, your joy, and your sense of direction.

**You probably know this very well:**
- You start many things but finish very few.
- Your phone pulls you in more often than you want to admit.
- You cannot fully enjoy what you are doing.
- Your goals live only in your head, without a real plan.
- You feel tired, but not satisfied.
- You have a constant feeling that you are wasting your potential.
